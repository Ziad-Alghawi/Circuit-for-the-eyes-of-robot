# Circuit-for-the-eyes-of-robot
First, I used the Tinkercad website.

Second, I used the required elements, which are as follows:

The Breadboard small

Arduino UNO R3

Two Resistors

Two Leds 

Then I connected the circuit as shown in the picture.

In the beginning I reached the Ground and the Power

I connected the resistors with the ground and with the leds 

Also I connected the leds with Arduino

Then I put the resistance of the resistor 100 ohm to turn on the led with 20mA 

Finally I wrote the code , I used code turn on the leds to 1 second then turn off for half second ,
I used this to reduce the power
